## Step-by-Step Usage Instructions

##### Minimal steps

1. Make sure you have the [STG](<http://docs.tibbo.com/taiko/lib_stg.htm>) library in your project
2. Add **include "settings\trunk\settings.tbh"** to the includes section of the global.tbh file
3. add **luis.tbh**, **luis.tbs**, **luis.html** to your project
4. Add [#define LUIS_DEBUG_PRINT 1](library_defines.md) to the defines section of the global.tbh file of your project. This way you will "see what's going on". Don't forget to remove this later, after you've made sure that the library operates as expected.
